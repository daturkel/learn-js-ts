# Learn JavaScript & TypeScript

A self-paced curriculum for experienced Python engineers who want to build AI-powered tools in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

## Who This Is For

- You know Python well (data structures, classes, async basics, type hints)
- You can already program; you don't need to learn loops and variables
- You want to build CLI tools, web services, and AI applications in JS/TS
- You want a broad survey of the ecosystem, not a deep dive into any single framework

## Prerequisites

- Working knowledge of Python
- A code editor (VS Code recommended for TypeScript support)
- Node.js 22+ installed ([setup instructions](./SETUP.md))
- Willingness to read documentation (this curriculum links to it heavily)

## How to Use This Curriculum

1. Work through modules in order — they build on each other
2. Each module has a `README.md` with explanations and an `exercises/` directory
3. Read the module README first, then do the exercises
4. Exercises include hints (click to expand) if you get stuck
5. Keep `reference/cheatsheet.md` open as a companion
